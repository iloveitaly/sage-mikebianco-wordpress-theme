# Sage Theme Template

This is a modified sage theme used for https://mikebian.co/. Figured I'd open source the template, there didn't seem to be many good lightly-customized examples of sage out there.

## TODO

- [ ] look into font flashing, i have a feeling using a `<font/>` tag will allow the browser to cache properly
- [ ] add tag and category descriptions to php template
- [ ] I think headers should be a bit bigger
- [ ] add rsync commands directly to this readme
