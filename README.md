# Sage Theme Template

This is a modified sage theme used for https://mikebian.co/. Figured I'd open source the template, there didn't seem to be many good lightly-customized examples of sage out there.

[Here's the corresponding blog post where I walk through how this was built.](https://mikebian.co/guide-to-upgrading-old-wordpress-themes/)

## TODO

- [ ] I think headers should be a bit bigger
- [ ] Maybe title case headers automatically? <https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/244705/change-all-post-titles-into-title-case-format>
